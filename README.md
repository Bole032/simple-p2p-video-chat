# simple-p2p-video-chat
Built with the simple-peer API

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
<p>The peer that starts the connection has to have a /#init suffix in the URL, that would be peer1, and the other one is peer2.        Peer1 immediately gets "Your ID", that string should be copied to peer2's "Other ID", then by clicking "connect" button you will get peer2's "Your ID", which should be copied to peer1's "Other ID". And finally peer 1 should click "connect" to start the video and text chat.</p>
